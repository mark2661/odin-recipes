             Forget takeaways – you can’t beat a homemade Margherita pizza topped with fresh tomato sauce and melted cheese.
             Here's how to master this everyday classic...
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g strong white flour</li>
            <li>400g can plum tomatoes (San Marzano are the best)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li> 
            <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), freshly grated</li>
            <li>200g mozzarella from a block, cut into chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml tepid water. Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. </li>
            <li>When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four</li>
            <li>
                Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt, 
                then either scrunch everything together with your fingers for a chunky sauce or blitz with a stick blender if you want it smooth.
            </li>
            <li>To make the pizza, heat a grill to its highest setting and get a heavy frying pan.</li>
            <li>
                Get the pan very hot and carefully slide the pizza onto it. Cook for 2 mins, then put the pan under 
                the grill for another 2 mins until the sides are puffed up and the cheese has melted. 
            </li>
        </ol>
